    <h3>What Is a Cobb Salad?</h3>
    <p><em>A Cobb salad is an American dish that consists of lettuce topped with bacon,<br>
        chicken, boiled eggs, tomatoes, and other ingredients arranged in neat rows.<br>
        It is traditionally served as a main course. The origins of the classic salad<br>
        is unclear, but many believe it was created in the late 1930s at<br>
        the Brown Derby restaurant in Hollywood.
